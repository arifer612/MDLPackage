* Ideas to implement

** DONE Remove /headers/ from library.py
I do not believe that they are necessary for posting/retrieving information on MDL
> Headers are truly unneeded for working on MDL. However, it would be wise to keep in mind that they might implement anti-bot aliasing techniques in the future so having a simple user-agent declaration might be a way to future-proof

** DONE Group library process into a unifying class
CLOSED: [2020-09-06 Sun 22:07]
Create a class in the root directory so users would not call upon anything in Library
