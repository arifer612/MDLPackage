* Ideas to implement

** DONE Remove /headers/ from library.py
I do not believe that they are necessary for posting/retrieving information on MDL
> Headers are truly unneeded for working on MDL. However, it would be wise to keep in mind that they might implement anti-bot aliasing techniques in the future so having a simple user-agent declaration might be a way to future-proof
