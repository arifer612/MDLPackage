# Setup
## Requirements

    python >= 3.6

This package has only been tested in a Linux and Windows 10 environment using Python 3.6.9. Translatability to MacOS or other versions of Python cannot be assured, but earlier versions of Python will probably not be able to support several features.

1. Clone the package from GitHub and run setup.py to install.

        git clone https://github.com/arifer612/MDLPackage
        cd MDLPackage
        python setup.py

2. Install using pip, while remembering to install the necessary dependencies when needed.
